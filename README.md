# StyleMail

Tired of dull, lifeless emails with boring text and attachments? StyleMail is a web app that allows you
to pick from and customize stylized HTML and CSS email templates. Simply pick a style, fill out your text 
and adjust a few settings, then click a button to copy the template into your email client to continue editing.
Whether you're looking to give a fun vibe for digital party invitations or a professional vibe for a business memo, 
spice up your emails with StyleMail!

Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
following your instructions.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  

You will also need:  
* A web browser such as Firefox, Chrome, or Edge (udated to the latest version)  
* A stable internet connection  
* The Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System was used for development of this application, but it is compatible with any OS as long as the OS supports a web browser.  

## Setup

After cloning the repo:  
There are no setup steps that must be taken before running the web application for the first time after cloning the repo.  

## Running

To run the app from a cloned repo:  
1.) cd into the stylemail folder that is in the root directory  
2.) use the 'npm start' command to run the React app in development ment  
3.) Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your internet browser  

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
